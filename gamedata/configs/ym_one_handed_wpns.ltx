; Weapon Lists
;; IMPORTANT
; Weapons NEED to have "single_handed = 1" set in their config in order for mod to work

; if Weapon is not in any lists, i.e. a mod weapon, it will default
; to being whitelisted
; Kinds as found in system.ltx
;  w_base
;  w_pistol
;  w_shotgun
;  w_smg
;  w_rifle
;  w_sniper
;  w_explosive
;  w_melee
;  w_misc


; Blacklist entries need an integer
; 0     =   No hipfire or ADS-ing
; 1     =   No hipfire but allow normal ADS
; 2     =   No hipfire, ADS with recoil debuff
; 3     =   Allow hipfire and ADS but with recoil debuff
; Allow hipfire and ADS but without any recoil debuff is just the whitelist

[wpn_sec_blacklist]
; wpn_remington700 = 2

; whitelist always takes priority over blacklist
; whitelist always defaults to "4"
